1. What does it mean to say "Pet inherits from Dog"?  
The pet class gets some of it's methods from dog and can add more 
methods on top of it that are exclusive to pet.
========================================================================
2. Why does Dog depend on Date, but Pet and Competitor don't?
Dog depends on Date to get the date of birth for the dog. Pet and 
Competitor don't depend on Date because they inherit the date 
dependency from Dog.
========================================================================
3. Why are there parameters in the Competitor constructor that are not
   properties of Competitor?
There are parameters in Competitor that are not properties of Competitor
because it needs to pass those parameters to the constructor of it's
super class.

4. What was the hardest part of this lab for you and why was it hard.
The hardest part of the lab was editing the code to fit the new classes.
It was hard because I find it easier to write code from scratch than 
change bits and pieces of larger chunks of code.
