Do Not allow your lines to be longer than the line of "=" characters.
Please leave the font at 12 pt.  Answers are in the lab instructions or 
in reading comments and code. The Java API has answers too. 
========================================================================
1. What does System.err.println("some message."); do? Be specific.

It ouputs the given message to the console in the same color as errors.
========================================================================
2. What is a unit test? 

A unit test is a test performed on a small piece of code to ensure it
works before you create an entire program and have to dig through it
to find an error.
========================================================================
3. When we catch a FileNotFoundException on trying to open a file for 
   input, it means there is no file with that name on disk.  What does 
   it mean when we catch a FileNotFoundException on trying to open a 
   file for output?

It means there is no file with that name on the disk.
========================================================================
4. String.format(), printf, and StringBuilder were all used in 
   this project.  Why did we need the StringBuilder in Orders?

We used StringBuilder to allow us to continue appending onto the string
until we were finished adding all the orders.
========================================================================
5. In String.format() (or printf) What does the descriptor "%08d" do?

It prints a given integer value with 8 left justified digits and leading
zeros if there are less than 8 digits given.
========================================================================
6. What was the hardest part of this lab for you and why was it hard.
The hardest part was working through the difference between the
