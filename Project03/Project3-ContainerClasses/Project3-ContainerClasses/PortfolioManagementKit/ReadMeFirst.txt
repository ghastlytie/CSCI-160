instructions.txt - some instructions for the project

implementationNotes.txt - has some suggestions about how to go about implementing the classes, and how to do the statistics and how to properly format the output. 

input data files: test0.txt, test1.txt, test2.txt use them one at a time as arguments in the project properties.  Your output should go to the console, the expected (correct) output is in the output files; out0.txt, out1.txt, out2.txt.
