Instructions for Stock Portfolio Management Problem

Start by designing the Stock class.  

Then work on each statistic by itself, starting with the
easier ones.  You can compare the results you get for each
company with my output files.

add the output for each statistic to the toString() method 
as you complete the calculation for it. Use a StringBuilder
for the toString() You need to look at the output files. Some
stats will be reported as 'n/a' and reporting them as 0.0 
will lose points.

Use the included unit tests for Stock and Portfolio classes.

Once you have completed all of the statistics and have
the output display arranged properly, you should go over
your program to make sure the format is good(Netbeans can do
that for you), identifiers are well named, and that it is 
adequately documented including the file headers, and JavaDoc for all methods.


Submit the entire project as a single zipped file.
