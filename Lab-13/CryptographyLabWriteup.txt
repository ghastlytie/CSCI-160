Do Not allow your lines to be longer than the line of "=" characters.

1.  Briefly explain random key cryptography.
For each character in a message, we assign a random number in the range
of characters to adjust that character by.
========================================================================
2.  Look at an ASCII chart and explain the correction we used (97). Why
    was that necessary?
97 in an ASCII chart is the 'a' character. This correction makes it so
the cryptKey[1][i] variable is a letter of the alphabet.
========================================================================
3. Explain Integer Errors. How do we prevent them?
An integer would be taken as the decimal ASCII value so it could try to
use an error causing character instead of that number. We prevent them 
by checking to see if the character is a digit when entered.
========================================================================
4. Explain input errors.  How do we prevent them?
Input errors are when the user gives an input that isn't accepted by
the code and causes an error. We prevent this by catching what could
cause an error like this. I ensured that any input was above a decimal
value of 97 so when guessMatches is called it wouldn't try to use a
negative value in an array call.

5. What was the quote that you solved?
"Recognizing the need is the primary condition for design."
Charles Eames, American designer

6. What was the hardest part of this lab for you and why was it hard.
Fixing the input error for non-alphanumerical characters. It was hard
because I had to debug the code and find where the issue was occuring.
