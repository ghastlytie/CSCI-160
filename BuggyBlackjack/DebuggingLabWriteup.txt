Do Not allow your lines to be longer than the line of "=" characters.

1.  Problems observed in play Without the Debugger (I found 3)

The program would not give the player another card.
Incorrect card math.
Doesn't register user input for continue question, infinite loop.
========================================================================
2.  Problems seen in memory using the Debugger  (I found 9)
    Specify the line number and what is wrong with the memory value
    1. Line 174: Should add one to userWins. *
    2. Line 39: amountOfCurrentBet was initialized as a new variable
	over the class variable *
    3. Line 147 & 155: logic always makes userWantsACard false, 
	should have || *
    4. Line 86: makes face cards worth 1, 2 or 3 instead of 10 *
    5. Line 209: never assigns the value of reply to userWantsToPlay
	therefore, an infinite loop *
    6. Line 116, 123 & 124: unused variables *
    7. Line 140: gets the wrong value for sumOfDealerCards *
    8. Line 176: ties count as the dealer winning *

========================================================================
3.  Problems fixed: Line number and new code
     1. Line 174: added a +1 counter for userWins
     2. LIne 39: removed int to get rid of new initialization of
	amountOfCurrentBet
     3. Line 147 & 155: changed && operator to || 
     4. Line 86: fixed the return statement to return 10 for 10 and face 
	cards
     5. Line 209: updated userWantsToPlay variable within while loop
     6. Line 116, 123 & 124: removed unused variables
     7. Line 140: changed dealersHoleCard to dealersNextCard
     8. Line 176: removed an = operator from the logic statement
	sumOfDealerCards >= sumOfUserCards

4. What was the hardest part of this lab for you and why was it hard?
The hardest part was digging through an entire program to search for 
small errors. It was hard because the IDE doesn't recognize anything is
wrong so you have to manually search for issues. This shows the
